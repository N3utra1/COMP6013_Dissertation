 There has been extensive research into applying \acrshort{ml} models to \acrshort{eeg} data; \cite{shoeb2010application} \cite{chakraborti2018machine}\cite{kumar2014machine} \cite{shen2022eeg} \cite{gupta2019epileptic} \cite{samiee2015long} \cite{zabihi2015analysis} \cite{wang2021one} \cite{zarei2021automatic} \cite{li2021seizure} \cite{shoeb2009application} \cite{wong2023eeg}. \\ Although there have been fewer attempts to apply ML models to identify the preictal state in a real-time setting with high accuracy, although they do exist \cite{usman2017epileptic}.   Dataset CHB-MIT \cite{shoeb2009application} \cite{PhysioNet} was taken from Boston Children's Hospital. It is a long-term dataset with recordings of 22 paediatric subjects, 5 male and 17 female, who have intractable seizures. The dataset contains 23 \acrshort{eeg} signals positioned on the scalp in the international 10-20 \acrshort{eeg} system \cite{sharbrough1991american}. The dataset is labelled with the timestamps of the onset and ending of each seizure. Over the course of several days the onsets and ends of a total of 182 seizures were annotated onto the long-term EEG data \cite{shoeb2009application} \cite{PhysioNet}. This dataset is utilized by many papers when working on real-time epileptic seizure detection, there have been many different approaches with detection accuracy reaching 92.23\% \cite{usman2017epileptic}   Usman et al. was able to achieve a preictal detection rate (sensitivity) of 92.23\% against the CHB-MIT dataset. \cite{usman2017epileptic} Usman noted that poor \acrfull{snr} within the dataset lead to a large amount of false positives and posed as a issue during his research. To combat this he combined the many \acrshort{eeg} signals into a single surrogate signal and then utilized \acrfull{emd} to increase the \acrshort{snr}. Usman et al. then broke the surrogate signal down and ``extracted multiple features including entropy, approximate entropy, and Hjorth parameters.'' In Usman's et al. papers, it was observed that both statistical and spectral features played a part in detecting the differences between interictal and preictal states so he also extracted spectral moments, and statistical moments to aid with his classification. He finally utilized a \acrfull{svm} taking in a continuous \acrshort{eeg} signal broken into non-overlapping one second sections and classifying if it was part of a preictal period \cite{usman2017epileptic}.   Gao at al. also used the CHB-MIT dataset to train various \acrshort{ml} models, although they developed a system which assigns weights to each sample in the dataset, and then uses a \acrfull{ga} to optimize the weights according to the increase of accuracy of prediction when applied to their validation set \cite{gao2022general}. Gao's et al. approach solved some common issues that surface when attempting to predict preictal periods; \acrshort{eeg} signals when monitoring epileptic seizures face an class imbalance problem, to address this researchers normally reduce the number of interictal samples \cite{ozcan2019seizure}, or increase the number of preictal periods, often using generative methods \cite{usman2021deep}, but as Gao et al. stated, this increased the uncertainty in the model. Goa et al. approach of assigning weights to samples avoids this downfall. Another benefit of applying Gao at al. methodology is the avoidance of the noisy label problem. This is where there is no standardized preictal period, with most researchers applying their own empirical fixed time length before the seizure. This can vary from 2 minutes before the ictal period to 30 minutes. By applying weights to different samples the \acrshort{ml} model ``can select and focus on more valuable samples for seizure prediction. These samples prompt the model to perform better on the validation set, thus further improving the generalization of the model.'' \cite{gao2022general}. Gao et al. was able to achieve a sensitivity of 85.9\%, and a false positive rate / hour of 0.09.
